      <h2 class="titles">About me</h2>
      <p>I've just finished studying English Linguistics: Theories, Interfaces, Technologies at Adam Mickiewicz University. This field of study allows me to develop both passion for languages and programming skills in Python and R. I thought that the back-end would be the most interesting field, but later I discovered that the data science branch is even more fascinating. My dream is to work with Python, but I am quickly learning new programming languages and library functions.</p>
