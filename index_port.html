    <h2>About me</h2>
    <div class="paragraphs">
    <p>I've just finished studying English Linguistics: Theories, Interfaces, Technologies at Adam Mickiewicz University. This field of study allows me to develop both passion for languages and programming skills in Python and R. I thought that the back-end would be the most interesting field, but later I discovered that the data science branch is even more fascinating. My dream is to work with Python, but I am quickly learning new programming languages and library functions.</p>

    <p> 3-month internship at Allegro, where I worked as a Data Analyst. The skills I gained were working in a remote team, working with Oracle (SQL), PowerPoint and Excel.</p>
    <p>During this internship, I had the opportunity to work with a large amount of data pertaining to client experiences (CX). I also learned the methods of presenting problems and proposing their solutions based on the pyramid principle.</p>
